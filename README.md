# The C Programming Language

Study notes and exercises for [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) 2nd edition.

**N.B**: I have previously worked through about half of the book several years ago without completing it, or sharing my solutions. I intend for this to be a refreseher on the fundementals for myself and to hopefully help others too.

Each exercise is completed using features/techniques/functionality that has been convered in the text up till that point (for the most part) to get the authors' desired experience from the exercise.

- i.e. not using pointers in chapter 1 exercises
