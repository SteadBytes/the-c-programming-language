The word count program can be tested by providing example inputs of known word counts and asserting the program produces the correct value. 

Some boundary condition inputs likely to produce bugs:
- Empty input
- Only newline characters
- Only escape characters (i.e. all tabs, newlines etc)
- Word starting after multiple blanks
